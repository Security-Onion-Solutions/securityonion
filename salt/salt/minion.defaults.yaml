#version cannot be used elsewhere in this pillar as soup is grepping for it to determine if Salt needs to be patched
# When updating the salt version, also update the version in securityonion-builds/images/iso-task/Dockerfile and saltify function in so-functions
salt:
  minion:
    version: 3003.1
    check_threshold: 3600 # in seconds, threshold used for so-salt-minion-check. any value less than 600 seconds may cause a lot of salt-minion restarts since the job to touch the file occurs every 5-8 minutes by default
