cat << EOF
This program will switch from the open source version of the Elastic Stack to the Features version licensed under the Elastic license.
If you proceed, then we will download new Docker images and restart services.

Please review the Elastic license:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch/master/licenses/ELASTIC-LICENSE.txt

Please also note that, if you have a distributed deployment and continue with this change, Elastic traffic between nodes will change from encrypted to cleartext!
(We expect to support Elastic Features Security at some point in the future.)

Do you agree to the terms of the Elastic license and understand the note about encryption?

If so, type AGREE to accept the Elastic license and continue.  Otherwise, just press Enter to exit this program without making any changes.
