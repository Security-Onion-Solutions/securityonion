# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply prepend
# them with $. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "$STR_VAR"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, $INT_VAR, $BOOL_VAR)

  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"

  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
