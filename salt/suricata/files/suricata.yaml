  # In multi mode, a file is created per thread. This will perform much

  # - %i -- thread id

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determine the seconds to wait after a hanshake or
# stream startup before the engine free the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if it spend that amount
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allow us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory on an
# efficient way keeping a good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom
# make sure to define the values at "- custom-values" as your convenience.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  On not specifying a value, we use no limits on the recursion.

# "ac-cuda" - Aho-Corasick, CUDA implementation
# "ac-ks"   - Aho-Corasick, "Ken Steele" variant

#
# The default mpm-algo value of "auto" will use "hs" if Hyperscan is
# available, "ac" otherwise.
#
# The mpm you choose also decides the distribution of mpm contexts for

# Selecting "ac" as the mpm would require "detect.sgh-mpm-context"
# to be set to "single", because of ac's memory requirements, unless the
# ruleset is small enough to fit in one's memory, in which case one can
# use "full" with "ac".  Rest of the mpms can be run in "full" mode.

## Netfilter integration
##

# When running in NFQ inline mode, it is possible to use a simulated
# non-terminal NFQUEUE verdict.
# This permit to do send all needed packet to suricata via this a rule:
#        iptables -I FORWARD -m mark ! --mark $MARK/$MASK -j NFQUEUE
# And below, you can have your standard filtering ruleset. To activate
# this mode, you need to set mode to 'repeat'
# If you want packet to be sent to another queue after an ACCEPT decision
# set mode to 'route' and set next-queue value.
# On linux >= 3.1, you can set batchcount to a value > 1 to improve performance
# by processing several packets before sending a verdict (worker runmode only).
# On linux >= 3.6, you can set the fail-open option to yes to have the kernel
# accept the packet if suricata is not able to keep pace.
# bypass mark and mask can be used to implement NFQ bypass. If bypass mark is
# set then the NFQ bypass is activated. Suricata will set the bypass mark/mask
# on packet of a flow that need to be bypassed. The Nefilter ruleset has to
# directly accept all packets of a flow once a packet has been marked.

# Netmap support
#
# Netmap operates with NIC directly in driver, so you need FreeBSD wich have
# built-in netmap support or compile and install netmap module and appropriate
# NIC driver on your Linux system.
# To reach maximum throughput disable all receive-, segmentation-,
# checksum- offloadings on NIC.
# Disabling Tx checksum offloading is *required* for connecting OS endpoint
# with NIC endpoint.

   # You can use the following variables to activate netmap tap or IPS mode.
   # If copy-mode is set to ips or tap, the traffic coming to the current
   # interface will be copied to the copy-iface interface. If 'tap' is set, the
   # copy is complete. If 'ips' is set, the packet matching a 'drop' action
   # will not be copied.
   # To specify the OS as the copy-iface (so the OS can route packets, or forward
   # to a service running on the same machine) add a plus sign at the end
   # (e.g. "copy-iface: eth0+"). Don't forget to set up a symmetrical eth0+ -> eth0
   # for return packets. Hardware checksumming must be *off* on the interface if
   # using an OS endpoint (e.g. 'ifconfig eth0 -rxcsum -txcsum -rxcsum6 -txcsum6' for FreeBSD
   # or 'ethtool -K eth0 tx off rx off' for Linux).

# the packets from ipfw.  For Example:
#
#   ipfw add 100 divert 8000 ip from any to any
#
# The 8000 above should be the same number you passed on the command
# line, i.e. -d 8000

  # option is the ipfw rule number AT WHICH rule processing continues

  # inspecting the packet for acceptance.  If no rule number is specified,
  # accepted packets are reinjected at the divert rule which they entered
  # and IPFW rule processing continues.  No check is done to verify
  # this will rule makes sense so care must be taken to avoid loops in ipfw.
