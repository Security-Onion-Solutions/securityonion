# Authentication.
#
# There are the following choices available:
#
#  - none: do not perform auth checks. If you can connect to the
#          socket you are allowed. This is suitable if there are
#          restrictions on connecting to the socket (eg, UNIX
#          socket permissions), or if there is a lower layer in
#          the network providing auth (eg, TLS/x509 certificates)
#
#  - sasl: use SASL infrastructure. The actual auth scheme is then
#          controlled from /etc/sasl2/libvirt.conf. For the TCP
#          socket only GSSAPI & DIGEST-MD5 mechanisms will be used.
#          For non-TCP or TLS sockets, any scheme is allowed.
#
#  - polkit: use PolicyKit to authenticate. This is only suitable
#            for use on the UNIX sockets. The default policy will
#            require a user to supply their own password to gain
#            full read/write access (aka sudo like), while anyone
#            is allowed read/only access.
#

# Set an authentication scheme for UNIX read-only sockets
#
# By default socket permissions allow anyone to connect
#
# If libvirt was compiled without support for 'polkit', then
# no access control checks are done, but libvirt still only
# allows execution of APIs which don't change state.
#
# If libvirt was compiled with support for 'polkit', then
# the libvirt socket will perform a check with polkit after
# connections. The default policy still allows any local
# user access.
#
# To restrict monitoring of domains you may wish to either
# enable 'sasl' here, or change the polkit policy definition.
#auth_unix_ro = "polkit"

# Set an authentication scheme for UNIX read-write sockets.
#
# If libvirt was compiled without support for 'polkit', then
# the systemd .socket files will use SocketMode=0600 by default
# thus only allowing root user to connect, and 'auth_unix_rw'
# will default to 'none'.
#
# If libvirt was compiled with support for 'polkit', then
# the systemd .socket files will use SocketMode=0666 which
# allows any user to connect and 'auth_unix_rw' will default
# to 'polkit'. If you disable use of 'polkit' here, then it
# is essential to change the systemd SocketMode parameter
# back to 0600, to avoid an insecure configuration.

# mechanism in /etc/sasl2/libvirt.conf
#auth_tcp = "sasl"

# Change the authentication scheme for TLS sockets.

# mechanism as well, by using 'sasl' for this option

#tcp_min_ssf = 112


# Change the API access control scheme
#
# By default an authenticated user is allowed access

# TLS x509 certificate configuration

#
# It is possible to override the default locations by altering the 'key_file',

# Logging controls
#

# Logging level: 4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug
# basically 1 will log everything possible
#
# WARNING: USE OF THIS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
#
# WARNING: It outputs too much information to practically read.
# WARNING: The "log_filters" setting is recommended instead.
#
# WARNING: Journald applies rate limiting of messages and so libvirt
# WARNING: will limit "log_level" to only allow values 3 or 4 if
# WARNING: journald is the current output.
#
# WARNING: USE OF THIS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
#log_level = 3

# Logging filters:
# A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given category
# of logs. The format for a filter is:
#
#    level:match
#
# where 'match' is a string which is matched against the category
# given in the VIR_LOG_INIT() at the top of each libvirt source
# file, e.g., "remote", "qemu", or "util.json". The 'match' in the
# filter matches using shell wildcard syntax (see 'man glob(7)').
# The 'match' is always treated as a substring match. IOW a match
# string 'foo' is equivalent to '*foo*'.
#
# 'level' is the minimal level where matching messages should
#  be logged:
#
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple filters can be defined in a single @log_filters, they just need
# to be separated by spaces. Note that libvirt performs "first" match, i.e.
# if there are concurrent filters, the first one that matches will be applied,
# given the order in @log_filters.
#
# A typical need is to capture information from a hypervisor driver,
# public API entrypoints and some of the utility code. Some utility
# code is very verbose and is generally not desired. Taking the QEMU
# hypervisor as an example, a suitable filter string for debugging
# might be to turn off object, json & event logging, but enable the
# rest of the util code:
#
#log_filters="1:qemu 1:libvirt 4:object 4:json 4:event 1:util"

# Logging outputs:
# An output is one of the places to save logging information
# The format for an output can be:
#    level:stderr
#      output goes to stderr
#    level:syslog:name
#      use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident
#    level:file:file_path
#      output to a file, with the given filepath
#    level:journald
#      output to journald logging system
# In all cases 'level' is the minimal priority, acting as a filter
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple outputs can be defined, they just need to be separated by spaces.
# e.g. to log all warnings and errors to syslog under the libvirtd ident:
#log_outputs="3:syslog:libvirtd"

# The host_uuid_source default is 'smbios'. If 'dmidecode' does not provide

# Keepalive protocol:
# This allows libvirtd to detect broken client connections or even

# keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity to check if the client is
# still responding; keepalive_count is a maximum number of keepalive
# messages that are allowed to be sent to the client without getting
# any response before the connection is considered broken.  In other
# words, the connection is automatically closed approximately after
# keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1) seconds since the last
# message received from the client.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, libvirtd will never send keepalive requests; however clients
# can still send them and the daemon will send responses.  When
# keepalive_count is set to 0, connections will be automatically
# closed after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity without
# sending any keepalive messages.
