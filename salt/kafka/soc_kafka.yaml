Note that only manager and receiver nodes are eligible to run Kafka. This configuration needs to be set before enabling Kafka. Failure to do so may result in Kafka topics becoming unavailable requiring manual intervention to restore functionality or reset Kafka, either of which can result in data loss.

  reset:
    description: Disable and reset the Kafka cluster. This will remove all Kafka data including logs that may have not yet been ingested into Elasticsearch and reverts the grid to using REDIS as the global pipeline. This is useful when testing different Kafka configurations such as rearranging Kafka brokers / controllers allowing you to reset the cluster rather than manually fixing any issues arising from attempting to reassign a Kafka broker into a controller. Enter 'YES_RESET_KAFKA' and submit to disable and reset Kafka. Make any configuration changes required and re-enable Kafka when ready. This action CANNOT be reversed.

        description: Overrides min.insync.replicas for the transaction topic. When a producer configures acks to "all" (or "-1"), this setting determines the minimum number of replicas required to acknowledge a write as successful. Failure to meet this minimum triggers an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend). When used in conjunction, min.insync.replicas and acks enable stronger durability guarantees. For instance, creating a topic with a replication factor of 3, setting min.insync.replicas to 2, and using acks of "all" ensures that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas fail to receive a write.
